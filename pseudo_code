Add your steps (pseudo-code) for the dice game here.

    init die1 
    init die2 
    init point
    init numRolls to 0
    init gameStart
    Ask to start game
    READ gameStart answer

    WHILE game_start is true
        generate number between 1 and 6 for dice 1
        generate number between 1 and 6 for dice 2
        init total to the sum of die1 and die2
        increment numRolls by 1
        IF total is 7 or 11
            print out the values of die 1 and 2
            display "you win"
            set gameStart to 'n'
        ELSE IF total equals 2,3 or 12
            print out the values of die 1 and 2
            display "you lose"
            set gameStart to 'n'
        ELSE 
            print out the values of die 1 and 2
            init char playAgain
            Ask to press R to roll again 
            READ playAgain answer

            WHILE playAgain is true
                assign point to total
                roll die 1 again
                roll die 2 again
                calculate dieSum
                increment numRolls by 1

                IF dieSum equals point
                    print out die 1 and die 2 values
                    display "You win"
                    Ask to play again
                    READ answer and set gameStart to the answer
                    set numRolls to 0
                ELSE IF dieSum is 7
                    print out die1 and die2 values
                    display "you lose"
                    Ask to play again
                    READ answer and set gameStart to the answer
                    set numRolls to 0
                ELSE
                    print out die1 and die2 values
                    Ask to press R to roll again
                    Read answer and assign to playAgain
                    increment numRolls by 1
    
    print out numRolls
    display bye message
    set gameStart to 'n'
